Ask a question: Tell me why the sky is blue?
LLM Answer: The sky appears blue to the human eye because of the way the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight. The Earth's atmosphere is composed of gases and particles that interact with sunlight as it passes through. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it is made up of a spectrum of colors ranging from red to violet. The shorter blue wavelengths of light are scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air in Earth's atmosphere. This scattering is called Rayleigh scattering. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This causes the blue light to dominate the color of the sky, giving it a blue appearance to our eyes.

This includes tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI systems are designed to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and perform tasks similar to human cognition.
